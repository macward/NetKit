# Task: Add Maximum Delay Cap to RetryPolicy

Status: done

## Objective
Prevent exponential backoff from producing unreasonably long delays (currently unbounded - attempt 30 = 34 years) by adding a configurable maximum delay cap.

## Context
- Related files: `Sources/NetKit/Retry/RetryPolicy.swift`
- Dependencies: None
- Severity: **CRITICAL** - Can cause requests to hang indefinitely

## Problem
The exponential delay calculation `base * pow(multiplier, attempt)` has no upper bound. With default values (base=1.0, multiplier=2.0), attempt 30 produces 1,073,741,824 seconds (~34 years).

## Steps
1. [x] Add `maxDelay: TimeInterval` parameter to `DelayStrategy.exponential` case
2. [x] Provide sensible default (e.g., 60 seconds)
3. [x] Apply `min(calculatedDelay, maxDelay)` in delay calculation
4. [x] Update factory methods to accept and pass through maxDelay
5. [x] Add tests for delay capping behavior
6. [x] Update documentation with new parameter

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Exponential backoff never exceeds configured maxDelay
- [x] Default maxDelay is reasonable (30-60 seconds)
- [x] Existing API remains backward compatible
- [x] All retry tests pass
- [x] Documentation updated

## Notes
- Consider also adding maxDelay to other delay strategies for consistency
- Jitter should be applied after capping to avoid exceeding max
