# Task: Long Polling Tests

## Objective
Add comprehensive tests for long polling functionality including timeout handling, cancellation, and reconnection behavior.

## Context
- Related files: `Tests/NetKitTests/NetKitTests.swift`, `Sources/NetKit/Mock/MockNetworkClient.swift`
- Dependencies: Tasks 013, 014
- Branch: feature/long-polling

## Steps
1. [x] Extend `MockNetworkClient` to support long polling simulation:
   - `stubSequence<E>(_ type: E.Type, responses: [E.Response], delays: [TimeInterval])`
   - `stubSequence<E>(_ type: E.Type, sequence: [Result<E.Response, NetworkError>], delays: [TimeInterval])`
   - Ability to simulate timeouts and reconnections via mixed results
2. [x] Create `LongPollingTests` test class with:
   - `LongPollingEndpoint Tests` - protocol defaults and custom values
   - `LongPollingConfiguration Tests` - presets and custom config
   - `LongPollingState Tests` - state equatable
   - `MockNetworkClient Sequence Tests` - sequence stubbing, mixed results, delays
   - `NetworkError NoContent Tests` - new error case
3. [x] Update README.md with long polling documentation and examples
4. [x] Run `swift test` to verify all tests pass (54 tests in 16 suites)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All new tests pass (14 new tests added)
- [x] Existing tests still pass (40 original tests)
- [x] README includes long polling usage example
- [x] MockNetworkClient supports polling simulation

## Notes
- Use short delays in tests (0.1s) for fast execution
- Test both success and error paths
