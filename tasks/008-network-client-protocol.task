# Task: NetworkClient Protocol

## Objective
Create the NetworkClientProtocol for dependency injection and testability.

## Context
- Related files:
  - `Sources/NetKit/Core/NetworkClientProtocol.swift`
- Dependencies: `002-endpoint-protocol.task`
- Branch: `feature/network-client-protocol`

## Steps
1. [x] Create `NetworkClientProtocol.swift` with:
   - `func request<E: Endpoint>(_ endpoint: E) async throws -> E.Response`
2. [x] Keep protocol minimal - only the essential method

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Protocol is `public`
- [x] Generic constraint on Endpoint
- [x] Returns associated Response type
- [x] Async throwing function

## Notes
- This is intentionally minimal
- The fluent API is provided via extension on the concrete client
- Mock client will also conform to this protocol
