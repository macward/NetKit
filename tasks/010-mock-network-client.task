# Task: MockNetworkClient

## Objective
Create a mock client for testing that allows stubbing responses and tracking calls.

## Context
- Related files:
  - `Sources/NetKit/Mock/MockNetworkClient.swift`
- Dependencies:
  - `001-models-foundation.task`
  - `008-network-client-protocol.task`
- Branch: `feature/mock-client`

## Steps
1. [x] Create `Sources/NetKit/Mock/` directory
2. [x] Create `MockNetworkClient.swift` as `actor` (thread-safe by design)
3. [x] Conform to `NetworkClientProtocol`
4. [x] Implement stubbing:
   - `stub<E: Endpoint>(_ type: E.Type, response: @escaping (E) -> E.Response)`
   - `stubError<E: Endpoint>(_ type: E.Type, error: NetworkError)`
   - `stub<E: Endpoint>(_ type: E.Type, delay: TimeInterval, response: @escaping (E) -> E.Response)`
5. [x] Implement call tracking:
   - `callCount<E: Endpoint>(for type: E.Type) -> Int`
   - Store called endpoints for verification
6. [x] Implement `reset()` to clear all stubs and call history
7. [x] Implement `request()` to return stubbed response or throw stubbed error

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Can stub success responses per endpoint type
- [x] Can stub errors per endpoint type
- [x] Can add delays to simulate network latency
- [x] Tracks call count per endpoint type
- [x] Reset clears everything
- [x] Throws if no stub configured for endpoint
- [x] Thread-safe

## Notes
- Use type identifier (ObjectIdentifier or String(describing:)) as key for stubs
- Consider storing actual endpoint instances for detailed verification
- Make it easy to use in XCTest
